<h1>The Best Movies According To Atharva</h1>
<h2>The top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away </h3>
<p>A careful reframing of the typical coming-of-age narrative, Spirited Away displays a fondness those infinitely awkward years, while showing us all how important they were in making us who we are today.</p>
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>Howl's Moving Castle is Japanese and anime, and therefore automatically more artistic than its US counterparts. The right cultural cachet gives you a lot of leeway.</p>
<h3> La La Land</h3>
<p>The movie has charm, at least, if nothing else. And as an attempt to pay homage to a vanishing world, La La Land is as dutiful as it is endearing - sweet, if a little sour, too.</p>
